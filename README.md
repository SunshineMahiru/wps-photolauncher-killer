# wps-photolauncher-killer
- This is a small tool designed to disable the use of the image browser in WPS.   
As we know, the Chinese version of WPS comes with these tools by default. Most importantly, they will start automatically and change the system's default settings for opening image applications. Therefore, I have provided this tool primarily for the purpose of sharing and redistribution.   
The original author of the source code should retain the ownership. If there are any issues or concerns, please contact me.
